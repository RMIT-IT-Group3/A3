<h3>Group performance review</h3>
<p>From the beginning of Assessment 2, our group worked dynamically and effectively to contribute, develop and publish a high standard of work. Regular, open communication between team members allowed us to create a friendly, positive and cohesive working environment. As a group, we were able to break down the Assessment and evenly distribute tasks, with each member working diligently to produce quality reports. Sharing responsibilities, contributing ideas, reviewing tasks and providing constructive feedback ensured we were producing a cohesive, well-researched and written final report and website, which we believe was reflected in our final mark. We were also able to tackle challenges and obstacles without friction, ensuring each team member felt valued and had a voice in our work.</p>
<p>Initially, the FlickDev Group was comprised of 6 members who all willingly shared individual marks & feedback from Assessment 1. In the lead up to the Assessment 2 due date, it was a clear that one member of our group was no longer interested in studying Introduction to Information Technology: this member left the group less than 1 week before Assessment 2 was due. The remaining group members were able to quickly adapt and overcome this obstacle, by working together to amend our final report and website contribution.</p>

<h3>Changes in process</h3>
<p>From our Assessment 2 individual and group reflections, we identified several areas that we wished to improve on for Assessment 3. In the first meeting we had to discuss Assessment 3, we immediately addressed and discussed these areas; we were then able to rapidly implement measures and processes that we believed would improve our group work going forward. These included establishing and using a shared format and structure for individual components and creating detailed agendas for group meetings prior to the meetings.</p>
