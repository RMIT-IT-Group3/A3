					<b>We were asked to reflect, as individuals and as a group, on how well we think we performed as a group in this assignment.</b>
					<br>
					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>Andrew B</h3>
					<p>Our team has successfully created a positive working relationship in which we distributed and assisted in the various tasks of the assignment fairly. This relationship came about through openly discussing and brainstorming ideas through
						the Microsoft Teams application in video chats and even voting in polls so that any decisions were made as a majority. It has been a pleasant experience to work in this team as the individual members were quite understanding and
						forthcoming when it came to any scheduling and deadline issues due to personal or professional life interference.</p>
					<p>Upon reflection of my contribution and activity within the group I believe I should take further steps to manage my time between my other commitments, such as personal and work life, and the commitments of my work in the team. It was
						particularly difficult adjusting in later weeks of the project with my suddenly changed work schedule and the time difference between my group members due to daylight savings time. I attempted to counteract my absences from team video
						meetings by being active in the teams chat as well as reading the summary of the meetings to make sure I would not miss important actions.</p>
					<p>A nice surprise for me in this team was how naturally people fell into roles such as team leading or project organisation as my previous experience in group work has seen either power struggles or no one willing to uptake any
						responsibilities.</p>
					<p>I have learnt how flexible a group and its members can be. My tendency to expect 200 percent from myself and to be on time or ahead on any work leads to stress and disappointment if I do not deliver. This team made me feel at ease if I
						were behind or unable to attend as they understood the issues and had faith that my work would be completed.</p>

					<h3>Christopher D</h3>
					<p>Continuing from Assessment 2, I am still very satisfied with the way our group has worked together on this assessment and the quality of the work we have produced.</p>
					<p>We were able to effectively communicate and discuss ideas, tasks and concerns through Microsoft Teams, where we ran weekly meetings and maintained a regular group chat. We efficiently broke down and distributed sections of the assessment
						between members, with individuals producing quality work and actively assisting with other member’s tasks and sections, contributing ideas or feedback where appropriate. Overall, the workload was evenly distributed between the group.</p>
					<p>While working on Assessment 3, I believe our group work could have been aided by taking a more structured approach and defining a clearer timeframe earlier in the project; while this has not significantly impacted the quality of our
						work, it may have helped reduce the overall load especially as it came closer to the due date.</p>
					<p>I was surprised by how useful Microsoft Teams has been in all aspects of our group work, as well as the features we were able to utilise. In addition to the chat channel and video meetings we commonly used, we were able to record
						meetings, upload and edit individual or group files, plan and allocate tasks to the group of individual members, and schedule meetings with reminders for the team.</p>
					<p>Finally, I have learnt how impactful it can be to have group members that are active, able and willing contributors to a project. I have felt that we were able to overcome challenges or concerns through effective communication, hard work
						and a shared commitment to the project.</p>

					<h3>Matt F</h3>
					<p>This project has run very well with good communication between all team members. The video meeting and text functionality of Microsoft teams has proved to be tremendously useful to the project with team members able to easily stay in
						contact throughout the project. The group has adopted a highly collaborative and familiar approach, discussing and working on most tasks together which had led to a positive working environment that I believe has been beneficial to all
						team members.</p>
					<p>Perhaps this familiarity has allowed the group to take a more informal and somewhat less structured process. While we have worked well together it is possible that if we had better defined positions and in turn a more informed and
						segmented approach, we would have been able to achieve more as a group. Though this would have been difficult as we are all new to the industry and are unable to bring substantial IT experience that would help define positions within the
						group. </p>
					<p>As with assignment two, I have been surprised at how smooth the process has been, and how we have been able to bring together a group of people with diverse backgrounds and experience from all across the country. I’ve learned that a good
						project planning relies on a level of knowledge and experience to be truly useful. Without true experience in the IT industry our planning had evolved as we have learnt. </p>

					<h3>Natalie J</h3>
					<p>As with Assignment 2, this project has progressed well. I would attribute this to the ease of communication between the team members and having Microsoft Teams at our disposal, which is a powerful communication and collaboration tool.
						The team feels much more at least with one another this time around, which has allowed for seamless collaboration and teamwork.</p>
					<p>Upon reflection, I feel as though I did not to contribute as much to this assignment as I did to Assignment 2. This is a personal disappointment for me as my lack of contribution was a result of competing priorities and stress. However,
						I am a firm believer in learning a lesson in any difficult situation, so I am grateful for the opportunity this has provided me to learn how to manage my priorities better. </p>
					<p>What I have found surprising is seeing how talented this team is. This assignment allowed us to really showcase the creativity of the team members, and it was great to see another facet of our team members skill sets.</p>
					<p>What I have learned about groups is that it works best when everyone is able to be heard. Even though we had a clear team leader, who did a fantastic job of managing behind-the-scenes issues, everyone had an opportunity to share their
						ideas and thoughts, and it came together to create a really positive and collaborative environment. </p>

					<h3>Thomas H</h3>
					<p>Since the formation of FlickDev Group, the ability and willingness of the members to work together has been highlighted and displayed excellently by the creation of a good working relationship to produce a working forum to achieve the
						desired result. Any problems or doubts have been cleared up by the use of questions and answers in the FlickDev Group chat facility in Microsoft Teams. I have found this to be a suitable method of communicating my ideas and being able to
						review and grasp the groups thinking on our assignment.</p>
					<p>No improvement is evident, as the group appears to be working well together with strong leadership displayed by Christopher Duncan, our elected Team Leader. </p>
					<p>I'm surprised at how well the team has melded together to produce what I believe to be a coherent and informative report so far within the such a short timeframe. This is highlighted by the different time zones team members live in and a
						willingness by all the team to make sure that everyone is included in group discussions and tasks.</p>
					<p>Since I've started working within FlickDev Group, I have learnt that there are different views and ideas relating to this subject and report writing which has helped me develop a better understanding of the subject matter and report
						writing. </p>
					<p>I believe that GitHub Desktop and Atom have been a godsend to allow for the clear, concise passage of information between all group members, which when used to its full capacity will allow us to complete the assignment within the time
						and required parameters. </p>

					<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
					<p>As a group, we have had a very positive experience in developing our project idea further.</p>
					<p>After receiving feedback for our Assessment 2 submission, we immediately discussed the constructive feedback provided by the marker and implemented measures to help address these areas. This included establishing a common format
						structure for reports and collaborative files to allow easier formatting and review and creating detailed meeting agendas to allow for more efficient meetings. Adopting these measures in the early stages of Assessment 3 allowed us to be
						more productive and time efficient.</p>
					<p>Developing our project further also afforded us the opportunity of allocating certain components or tasks to team members who had experience or strengths with certain tools or areas including design, wireframing and video editing. To
						continue the creation and output of a high standard of work, other team members happily took on extra tasks to balance the overall workload to support these individuals; we believe this is more predominantly reflected in our app prototype
						and Assessment 5 video presentation.</p>
					<p>Although our work as a group has developed to be even more productive and frictionless, there are a small number of aspects that could be improved upon. We believe that as a group, we could have spent more time and attention early in the
						project dividing the report into tasks and allocating these between members: this would have helped prevent some confusion or excess work being created. We have also identified that creating a detailed, planned timeframe earlier in the
						project would also allow our group to work more efficiently, with clear deadlines affording us the opportunity to better review and amend work where needed.</p>
					<p>While there are always many surprises when working as a group on a project, as a group we have been pleasantly surprised by how well our team has formed and melded together. We were able to easily and smoothly form a team and designate a
						team leader, with each member providing even contribution and actively supporting other members of the group. We were also surprised by our ability to quickly establish and develop a friendly rapport within the group, which has helped to
						create a positive and relaxed working environment.</p>
					<p>Through our work and collaboration, we have learnt that groups work best when everyone can be heard effectively and allowed the opportunity to collaborate. We have discovered how effective online tools like Microsoft Teams are in helping
						to create a cohesive group and contribute to a positive work environment. We have also learnt that there are multiple methods to complete tasks and address challenges, and promoting a group culture of respectful, understanding, active and
						willing contributors is extremely important in creating a project that we can take pride in.</p>
