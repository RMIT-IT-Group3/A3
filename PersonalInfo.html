									<p>My professional Background is in news media, currently working for Nine News in its regional studio department editing video and various other studio tasks to help organise the bulletins. I consider myself lucky having the opportunity to work and excel in my work environment without any formal qualifications on paper however I have come to the realisation that I no longer wish to work in such an industry and such want to pursue a larger interest in Information Technology.</p>
									<p>With little IT experience beside general computing I recently began taking a keen interest to the multifaceted IT systems that I use at work on a daily basis, how they operate, The tools used to create said systems and programs, most importantly how could the user experience be improved. My interest in IT is not on one specific field but rather in the aim of understanding, implementing and improving IT concepts to adjust my focus to any IT based career path. </p>

									<h2>Test Results</h2>

									<b>Myer-Briggs: INFP-T</b>
										<p>Mediator types are said to be dedicated and considerate employees, or in this case group members, and feel most motivated when thinking of ways to help others. I believe this the most appropriate information in regards to my position in this group and what I have to offer during this time as I do often find myself at work more likely to excel in tasks that benefit or support another member of my team in some way.  </p>
										<br>
										<b>Vark Learning</b>
										<p>The Visual Aural Read/write and Kinesthetic test results show me to have a learning preference to kinesthetic learning, this means within group work I prefer may prefer a “hands on” approach to learning and interacting with our assessment. This preference however is not much use in the current situation as we are unable to meet up physically.  </p>
										<br>
										<b>Hogan Personality Inventory Test</b>
										<p>Within the Hogan personality inventory, I scored a 10 out of 10 in the Quickness category, this category reflects how much I value education and as a high scorer I am to be insightful and focused on my interest, I believe his insightful trait along with a focused interest on the project may be beneficial to my group during the assessment. </p>
										<br>
										<b>Ideal Job </b>
										<p>As I am unsure really of where within IT I want to go for my ideal job I chose a field that currently interests me and then decided to aim high. My ideal job is a cyber security specialist of which would involve advising decisions and solutions for security requirements across many teams and projects within a company. The job role would obviously require many years of prior experience and knowledge of complex systems which is why I thought it important to pick such a role as to give myself a road map of sorts to follow if this is indeed the job role that I aim for in my future. I believe the problem solving and team oriented designing within this job increase the likelihood of my own job satisfaction. </p>
										<br>
										<b>Career Plan </b>
										<p>Obviously continuing to study is a must if I want to work in this field, I may also take on a diploma in cyber security to further my knowledge. Further into the future gaining employment into various low level cyber security roles would benefit me as I will gain experience and contacts in order to be able to achieve the requirements of this position. </p>

									<br>
									<b>GitHub Profile : https://chrisduncan92.github.io/1personalinformation.html </b>
									<br>
									<br>
																		<p>I am a 28-year-old RMIT student that works full time as a customer service representative and technician at a major IT retailer. My hobbies include PC gaming, reading, playing the drums, making music with friends, and chilling out at home with my partner and our kitten, Yen.   </p>
																		<p>I have always had a keen interest in learning and understanding how IT products work and function together and how the technology can benefit individuals, groups and cultures. Most of my experience in IT comes from my current employment, which involves determining and troubleshooting problems with IT products or systems and configuring these aspects to suit customer’s needs.  </p>

																		<h2>Test Results</h2>

																		<b>Myer-Briggs: INFJ</b>
																			<p>The test indicated that I am an Advocate personality, who see a great cause in helping others achieve goals and work with determination and passion. I believe an Advocate personality is a massive benefit to a team or group in approaching challenges or ideas in a unique, creative way; their determination and passion will ensure they work effectively at individual tasks and contribute to projects.   </p>
																			<p>I believe this Advocate personality type does accurately describe my approach to tasks or challenges in a personal and professional setting, as well as my professional goal of always providing the right solution to a customer. I believe my work and the outcomes I achieve are amplified by my empathetic and sensitive approach to tasks, challenges, and communication; I am interested to discover new methods or techniques to solve problems and am always ready to assist my work colleagues where possible. I am eager to further develop the way I approach and work through challenges and look forward to constructing a successful project with my group. </p>
																			<br>
																			<b>Learning Style: Pragmatist </b>
																			<p>The learning style test suggests that I primarily learn in the Pragmatist style, where learning is most effective using practical examples, case studies and discussions. In a group or team environment, a Pragmatist learner will likely be ready to jump into tasks or challenges, especially if they have had previous experience with the work.  </p>
																			<p>Through the course of my professional career, I have found that I can learn more effectively through a hands-on approach to tasks or problems, which I believe fits within the Pragmatist learning style. I find the use of visual aids or instructions extremely beneficial in understanding issues or developing a new skill or technique. </p>
																			<br>
																			<b>Leadership Test: Postmodern Leader </b>
																			<p>The leadership style test determined that I most suit the Postmodern leadership style, which is an altruistic style in the way that leaders can bring joy to others by their role. A Postmodern leader can help create an open, constructive and upbeat team environment, encouraging team members to apply their ideas, skills and knowledge to create positive change in the world.</p>
																			<p>I believe the Postmodern leadership style does match aspects of my personality and coincides with the personality test I have undertaken: Postmodern leaders require a high degree of empathy and sensitivity in order to establish and develop personal connections and effectively recognise and address issues and concerns. I personally find great joy and fulfillment in helping others, both inside of outside of work, or knowing that knowledge or a skill I passed on to someone has helped them achieve a goal or complete a task of their own. </p>
																			<br>
																			<b>Ideal Job </b>
																			<p>I am interested in studying to become an IT or ICT Manager.  </p>
																			<p>I believe an ICT Manager is an individual who leads and manages a team of dedicated staff in developing and maintaining IT resources within a business or organisation. They would need to communicate with other teams or departments, discuss and present new ideas or changes, and maintain the wellbeing of the IT team. An ICT Manager would need extensive knowledge of IT systems and the way they interact, the ability to successfully lead and manage a team, and be a strong and effective communicator. </p>
																			<p>This role appeals to me because I am confident in my existing knowledge and my ability to effectively communicate with various parties to provide solutions, as well as demonstrate valuable conflict resolution and team management skills. </p>
																			<br>
																			<b>Career Plan </b>
																			<p>I believe that many of the skills required to become an IT or ICT manager can be obtained by studying a Bachelor of Information Technology or similar degree, with electing to complete a Minor Stream in Management; completing an additional Graduate Diploma of Management would grant further skills and resources and be highly beneficial when applying for management positions. I believe obtaining successful employment as part of an IT team would demonstrate to a potential employer that you can successfully operate as an individual and as part of a team. Once I have developed experience working as part of a team, I would then look for opportunities or employment as an ICT Manager. </p>

																			<br>
																			<br>
																												<p>I have a background in Graphic Design and Photography with a Diploma of Graphic design and a Graduate Diploma of Creative Industries. I have recently re-evaluated my career aspirations and direction which has led me to peruse my interest in IT and commence studying Information Technology at RMIT. The only experience I have in IT was one of my first jobs where I worked for a computer rental company where I imaged returning units and assembled computers to customer specifications. My current interest in the IT industry in the software and web development areas rather than hardware. I find the intersection of information, technology and human interaction fascinating, and I believe that we are only just starting to explore what is possible. I was born in Fiji, immigrated to Australia at the age of 7 and have lived in Perth WA since I was nine years old. Outside of work, I like to spend time outdoors with my family enjoying activities such and bushwalking and discovering the hidden spots that Perth and surrounding areas have to offer.</p>

																												<h2>Test Results</h2>

																												<b>Myer-Briggs: ISTP</b>
																													<p>Working in a team the Myers Briggs Personality Test indicates that individuals with ITSP personalities are “practical, task-oriented team members” (Truity, The Best Careers for ISTP Personality Types). This pragmatic and practical outlook will allow me to focus on the work at hand to assist the team to achieve our best. ISTPs or Virtuosos have been identified as enjoying attending to a list of items that needs fixing or being attended to (16Personalities, 2020). I believe this trait will allow me to assist in a teamwork situation as I will enjoy ensuring that our submission meets the requirements of the assignment tasks.    </p>
																													<br>
																													<b>Learning Style: </b>
																													<p>The learning style test results suggest that my personal learning style is fairly well balanced between Reflector, Theorist and Pragmatist learning styles. Though I feel that I identify with the reflector style most strongly. Reflectors tend to stand back and observe rather than directly engaging, preferring to take a slower approach to consuming information.  </p>
																													<br>
																													<b>Leadership Style: Contrarian Leader   </b>
																													<p>The leadership style test has highlighted that I am not a binary thinker and that I embrace the grey areas allowing me to consider conflicting ideas (Montgomery, 2018). I believe that this personality attribute will be very helpful in a team situation as whenever individuals work together there are bound to be varied and opposing ideas and points of view, having the ability to consider each perspective can only lead to better outcomes for the team. The test also indicates a propensity to listen to advice from experts which I believe will allow me to be flexible with my own direction, changing and adapting it to new ideas and information when needed for a better outcome. </p>
																													<br>
																													<b>Ideal Job </b>
																													<p>My ideal job is working as a developer. I am interested in this role as I believe that this position will involve the understanding and implementation of entire projects, from UX research and methods, through to the development of the project using languages (JavaScript, CSS and HTML) and tools (AWS, GIT and Figma) to create finished products. Being involved in and creating projects for the entire process appeals to me as I enjoy creating finished tangible products along with the more analytical and empathic aspects of the user experience process.</p>

									<b>Student No: s3871504</b>
									<br>
									<b>GitHub Profile : https://nataliejaensch.github.io/My-Profile.github.io/  </b>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p>I was born in Warragul, Victoria, in December 1987. I graduated from Trafalgar High School in 2005. Unlike many of my peers, I had not decided what I wanted to do, career-wise, so I opted to get a job rather than go to university straight away. My first job was as a trainee law clerk at a law firm in Traralgon. It sparked an interest in law, so I completed my Certificate IV in Business Administration as a pathway to study law. My plans were put on hold when I discovered that I was expecting my first child. My son was born in December 2007, just shy of my 20th birthday. From the time my son was 12 months old until when my daughter was born in 2010, I worked as a law clerk at a firm in Morwell. When I re-entered the workforce in 2013, I worked as an administrative assistant at an accounting firm in Morwell. </p>
									<p>It was when I took the job at the Morwell accounting firm that I discovered my interest in IT. The firm was transitioning from using Reckon APS for their accounting preparation software to Xero, which is a Cloud-based accounting system. I was the champion for this process and worked closely with the developers to complete the transition efficiently and successfully. Similarly, the Traralgon-based accounting firm that I began working for in 2017 also underwent a transitionary process. I was nominated as the process champion due to my previous experience and my technical skills and interest. Again, I worked closely with the developers to ensure that this process was smooth. Transitioning almost one million documents from one application to another required a lot of back-end mapping, but ultimately a good result was achieved. I believe that it was my keen interest in IT and my ability to learn these technical skills quickly that assisted with ensuring this good result. </p>

									<h2>Test Results</h2>

									<b>Myer-Briggs: INTJ</b>
										<p>The results of my Myer-Briggs Personality Test concluded that I am an INTJ or the Architect personality type. An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one." The INTJ personality type is the rarest of the 16 types, making up two per cent of the population. Female INTJs are even rarer, making up just 0.8%. People with this personality type are best suited to IT careers owing to their ability to convert complex principles into clear and actionable strategies.  </p>
										<br>
										<b>Learning Style </b>
										<p>According to the results of the learning style test, I am 40.2% Pragmatic and 40.2% Theorist. Pragmatists prefer the practical approach, needing to be able to put their learning into practice in the real world. The pragmatic approach to learning includes the use of practicals, case studies, problem setting, and discussions. Theorists prefer to think through their problems in a logical manner and value rationality and objectivity. Learning methods suited to theorists are models, classroom response systems, story-telling and quotes, and tutorials.   </p>
										<br>
										<b>Fisher Temperament Inventory (FTI)  </b>
										<p>The Fisher Temperament Inventory (FTI) is a measure of personality based on the idea that an individual’s behaviour is influenced by the dominance of particular neurotransmitters in the brain. The FTI identifies four chemical subsystems of the brain - dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and oestrogen - and measures four scales of behaviour believed to be produced by those systems, to give a result on an overall temperament type. The FTI test consists of 62 statements that the individual rates on a four-point scale of how much they agree with each statement. My answer profile matches most strongly to the Cautious/Social Norm Compliant temperament. This temperament is dominated by the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is involved in relaxation and social belonging. People with this temperament are orderly and careful. They like to fit in with their social group and are wary of people who deviate. They are loyal. </p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>There is consistency in each of the results of the tests. Each of them describes me as taking a logical, pragmatic, cautious approach to matters which I believe is why I am drawn to law, accounting and IT. </p>
<p>I do not feel the results would influence my behaviours in terms of conduct or treatment of others in the team. However, because the results provide a level of clarity about what motivates me and the reasons behind particular behaviours, it may influence decisions such as volunteering to undertake a task or project if it suits my strengths. </p>
<p>From a management standpoint, I believe these tests offer a valuable insight into the mindset and personality traits of the person taking them, which can help when assembling special project teams or staff structures. </p>

										<br>
										<b>Ideal Job </b>
										<p>I am quite open-minded when it comes to what my ideal job in IT would be. My initial thoughts are that I would like a technical support/help desk role because I feel that it would combine my vast customer service experience with my learned IT skills. My ideal job would give me exposure to different problems and issues and allow me to maximise the use of the skills and knowledge gained from my tertiary learning. </p>
										<p>I found a Desktop Services Administrator position advertised on Seek.com.au. The role has a high level of customer service via face-to-face and telephone methods, with a focus on process improvement and innovation to provide a better experience for the customers. I have previous experience in finance and accounting, so the industry is not entirely unfamiliar to me. The advertised role is for a large organisation with multiple locations. A role in a large multi-faceted organisation appeals to me because, aside from flexibility, there tends to be more opportunity to professional development and growth within the organisation that often does not exist in smaller businesses. The advertised role calls for experiences in several specific products and systems, such as Microsoft Back Office products, ServiceNow and Patch management, and ITIL frameworks. In addition to technical knowledge, the role requires demonstrated experience with face to face customer service in a dynamic, product-driven environment. </p>
										<p>I have high-level customer service skills, and I also believe that my interpersonal and communication skills would be well suited to this position. The role calls for a candidate who is approachable, empathetic and helpful, which I feel are qualities that I possess. Coming from an accounting background has given me much exposure to people who are often feeling frustrated with organisations such as the ATO. The ability to understand complex governmental processes and then convey them to clients sympathetically and concisely is a critical skill that I have developed over my career, which I feel would be an asset to this particular role. </p>
										<br>
									<b>Career Plan</b>
									<p>My ideal career path would be helpdesk / technical support officer. My motivation for this is because I enjoy finding solutions to problems and I enjoy the feeling of being able to help a person who is feeling frustrated by their technology.</p>
									<p>In addition to completing my Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT in 2023, I have been active in making good connections and networking with technical support people within the government organisation that I work for. They have been providing useful information and knowledge by talking me through solutions to IT problems that I have encountered, and also by sending me invitations to exclusive IT showcase webinars hosted by the organisation. They can see the value in teaching me things about our IT systems which could prove useful in future if I decided that I wanted to transfer to the IT department from my current role, or to provide an IT supporting role in my existing team.</p>

									<b>GitHub Profile : https://thomasharlow.github.io/RMIT-A1/ </b>
									<br>
									<br>
																		<p>My name is Thomas Harlow. I am 36 years old. I work full time at Direct Mail Ontime and study part-time with RMIT in Introduction to I.T., I've got several hobbies, I enjoy playing tabletop Warhammer 40k, I play Magic The Gathering, various board games and many different types of video games with friends, one of my favourite game types are those deceitful games like Trouble in Terrorist town, but I am a terrible liar in those games. I have wanted to go to University for many years now to learn I.T. Still, it was not until the current world crisis that pushed me to finally start learning since my current knowledge is relatively limited when it comes to I.T. </p>

																		<h2>Test Results</h2>

																		<b>Myer-Briggs: Entertainer</b>
																			<p>After doing the Myers-Briggs, the test results show me that I am kind of in the middle when it comes to most things, that I should be able to work with a lot of people effectively while not being too over the top to annoy my team.   </p>
																			<p>If I were forming a team, I'd try and find people who I can work effectively with, and that I'd try and create a well-rounded team that can compensate for my weaknesses. </p>
																			<br>
																			<b>Learning Style: Theorist </b>
																			<p>I've always been more of a visual learner, but I do like learning the theory behind what I am working or learning and finding background information.  </p>
																			<p>After doing this test It'll help me, deep-dive, into theoretical problems of the project allowing others to focus practical side of troubleshooting, and see if I am suited as a theorist, at this stage I wouldn't like to pigeon hole myself, I'd like to spend time exploring the practical course and build up an even skill set. As a leader, I'd form a team with different learning styles to balance out the group. </p>
																			<br>
																			<b>Leadership Test: Front-line Style  </b>
																			<p>I got Front-line Leader, but I wasn't sure what that entailed so I read "Seven Simple Strategies for Frontline Leaders" to get a clearer understanding of what a Front-line leader is and should do. Hence, the test helped me learn more about my leadership style and means I can hopefully help my team. </p>
																			<p>When it comes to how my results will influence my behaviour in my team, I don't think the results will influence my behaviour. I'll keep doing what I do with my team, be there for them and hear them out with any problems they have with work or real life and help if I can, and just be seen working to inspire them and show that I am also helping.  </p>
																			<p>If I ever form a team, I'd create a team that I could work well with and get along, if not then work to get to know them so we can work as a team more effectively. </p>
																			<br>
																			<b>Ideal Job </b>
																			<p>My Idea Job is a Penetration Tester (Offensive Security) which is an I.T. security specialist that try to hack into networks to find potential vulnerabilities in the system, they've been called "Ethical hackers". My friend is a penetration tester, and his stories are what got me interested in I.T., the position is appealing to me because it takes skill and knowledge to hack and find the weak points. I currently don't have any of the skills or experience required for the job, but that's why I am going to University, to dedicate myself to learning the skills needed to be a Penetration Tester. </p>
																			<br>
																			<b>Career Plan </b>
																			<p>My plan is to study hard to learn how to be a penetration tester by going into a Security course and a Networking course. Learning the different code languages, how to code better, trying and getting better at writing reports, understanding the other operating systems, and my friend, an actual Penetration tester, will give me some tips and resources. </p>
