									<p>With so much content available between various content streaming services – think of services like Netflix, Stan, Amazon Prime and Disney Plus, to name a few – it is becoming increasingly more difficult to decide on a title to watch. This is especially true when trying to choose a title for more than one person, as the question becomes can you find something you both enjoy?  </p>
									<p>Enter FlickDeck. An app designed to help streamline the process of deciding what to watch and where to access it from, FlickDeck offers the ability to link multiple user accounts and create a shared list of ‘liked’ or relatable content. These content lists are presented to each user in a simple card format, and the user simply swipes, or ‘flicks’ left or right on each content card to indicate if they like or dislike the content. Once a content match is found, the users will be alerted to the match and be notified of where they can access the content. FlickDeck is designed to be easy and fun to use, with the aim of allowing users to spend more time watching content they are interested in and less time deciding on what to watch. </p>

									<h2>Our Motivation </h2>
									<p>Content streaming services have fast developed to become the preferred method of entertainment for most households, with Australia alone boasting at least 11.9 million Neftlix subscribers (Williams, 2020). When it comes to deciding on what to watch, however, a 2016 American study found that on average users spend over 17 minutes browsing Netflix before selecting something to watch; additionally, at least 40% of users were interested in watching something different to their partner or spouse (Moscaritolo, 2016). </p>
									<p>The benefit of FlickDeck is that it could be expanded to include a variety of streaming services, while also allowing users to customise what services they will receive recommendations from. </p>
									<p>FlickDeck presents a unique product opportunity that could be marketed to a large group of content consumers. As the number of streaming services and subscribers continue to grow in the future, the need for a product like FlickDeck will only become more relevant. </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Landscape</h2>
									<p>Currently, there are several content curation or aggregator services available on the market, such as Reelgood or JustWatch, that allow users to browse and search for content from multiple streaming services. Of these two services, however, Reelgood is not available in Australia; additionally, neither of these services provide a personalised content delivery system, with the emphasis falling on the user to search and filter through large numbers of titles. </p>
									<p>There is also the app dinggo which shares FlickDeck’s content presentation style and allows groups of users to swipe through content; however, dinggo is not available in Australia and, like Reelgood or JustWatch, does not provide a personalised content delivery system. </p>
