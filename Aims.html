										<h1>Aims</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Our aim for this project is to design and develop FlickDeck, a fun and easy to use app that will help simplify the streaming content decision process for partners or groups of users through an iOS, Android and web-based application. </p>


									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Goals</h2>
									<b>1. Develop functioning prototype</b>
									<p>For this project, our primary goal is to develop a functioning prototype of the FlickDeck mobile app: this will allow us to demonstrate the core user experience (UX) and the workflow of the app, while also providing an initial user interface (UI) concept.</p>

									<b>2. Test working prototype </b>
									<p>The prototype will need to be tested frequently to ensure it matches the project’s aim. As the project develops further and changes are made or new features added, regular testing will ensure the prototype is fun, easy to use and intuitive, as well as allow FlickDev Group to identify and address potential issues</p>

									<b>3. Create a video presentation</b>
									<p>A video presentation will be extremely useful in informing audiences of the project and clearly communicating its aim and core design. Incorporating a demonstration of the functioning prototype will also help users visualise the simplicity and benefits afforded by using the app.</p>

									<b>4. Create data scraping tool</b>
									<p>Due to a lack of official APIs for major streaming services, FlickDeck will need to rely on a data scraping tool to capture movie & TV show data from the platforms. The tool will capture crucial information including the title, genre, year of release, cast and crew information, which will be used to create content and user profile databases.</p>

									<b>5. Create content databases </b>
									<p>Creating content databases for the data scraped from streaming services will be crucial in allowing FlickDeck to quickly and reliably display title content. Using a database management system like MariaDB Server will allow relational databases to be created, queried and updated by FlickDeck. Relational databases allow for quick comparisons between records and tables, as well as the ability to create new tables from a single query (e.g., creating a ‘Match’ table upon content matches.)</p>

									<b>6. Create user profile database</b>
									<p>FlickDeck will need to create and maintain a user profile to track a user’s liked, disliked and matched content. Building this user data will allow for FlickDeck to recommend more appropriate content; the data will be stored and managed by using MariaDB Server, which will allow for quick comparisons between multiple user profile tables.</p>

									<b>7. Create mobile app for Android and iOS software platforms</b>
									<p>FlickDeck is primarily designed to be a mobile app, available on the latest Android and iOS software platforms. FlickDeck’s core UX – flicking left & right on content titles – will be best suited to a mobile app platform; a mobile app also offers user convenience as they can simply pull out their mobile device to access FlickDeck, rather than change to a web browser on their TV or regular streaming device.</p>

									<b>8. Create web interface</b>
									<p>FlickDeck will also be available as a web interface for users who find it easier or more accessible to access web-based content. The web interface will offer the same functions and similar UX as the mobile apps.</p>

                  <b>9. Create payment platform</b>
									<p>FlickDeck could be marketed as a service that requires a small, one-off payment to use; as a result, FlickDeck will need to include a secure payment platform such as Stripe or PayPal to ensure customer’s data is safe during the payment process.</p>
