<h2>History of FlickDev</h2>
<p>We all undertook the Introduction to Information Technology at RMIT, commencing in September 2020. Assignment 1 was an individual task and required us to develop a plan for an original project idea.  </p>
<p>Our instructions for Assignment 2 was firstly to form a team. From there, we were to develop a website that expanded upon one of the project ideas from our individual assignments and present it on a website.  </p>
<p>There have been few changes to the project, aside from a team member departing toward the end of Assignment 2. We reviewed and discussed the feedback we received from Assignment 2 as a group and used that as a gauge as to whether we felt the project idea needed to be changed. After some deliberation, we felt collectively that the project idea did not require any significant changes, so we were happy to progress with the developing the existing plan further. </p>
<p>Overall, we were pleased with the feedback we received from Assignment 2, but made a point of taking the comments and constructive criticism that was provided and used it to improve our decision-making and processes when developing the plan for FlickDeck.  </p>

	<h2>User Experience</h2>
	<p>FlickDeck will function as an application that can be downloaded on an Apple iOS, Android device or accessed via a website. </p>
	<p>After accessing FlickDeck, users will be prompted to create an account with a unique username; once complete, they will be prompted to connect and link their account with another user they plan to watch content with, such as a partner or spouse. The users then confirm several preliminary preferences, such as what streaming services they have access to, content type, genre and age classification, which is used to start creating a user profile. Once linked, the content determining process will begin. Each user will be shown a content card that displays the poster, title, length, year of release, and brief synopsis of a specific movie or TV show. The user then has 2 choices:</p>
<p>	•	Tap the ‘like’ button, to indicate they are interested in the content </p>
<p>	•	Tap the ‘dislike’ button, to indicate they are not interested in the content </p>
<p>The users will proceed through a set number of content cards, with each like or dislike being recorded in a profile database. If the users reach the end of the set, they will be prompted to continue. </p>
<p>When FlickDeck recognises that linked users have both liked a particular content card, the users will be alerted to the match via a full screen notification, with a link to the streaming service the content is available on; alternatively, the users can choose to keep flicking if they wish to find different content.</p>
<p>In order to display updated content to users, FlickDeck will utilise a database of movies and TV shows taken from major streaming platform libraries, such as Netflix, Stan or Amazon Prime. It will then only access the data relevant to the user’s accessible streaming services.
To quickly and easily add friends, FlickDeck will have the option of displaying a unique ‘friend code’ in the form of a scannable QR code; while one user displays their friend code, the other user simply taps the ‘Scan’ button and use their device’s camera to scan the QR code, which will link the user profiles together. Users also have the option to search for FlickDeck users by their unique username, which will allow users to link accounts from a distance.</p>
<p>FlickDeck will allow users to save multiple linked accounts for future use, with a list of saved users displayed after accessing the app.</p>
<p>Via the preferences section, the user will be able to add new streaming services or select what services they would like content displayed from. They will also have the option to log in with a different FlickDeck account or log out of the current account.</p>
<p>The overall functionality and user experience of FlickDeck will be designed to be simple and intuitive, with the aim of streamlining the content-making decision so users can relax and enjoy the movie or TV show. This will be assisted by offering users a list of common interests to select from rather than browsing for extended periods.</p>
<hr class="major" />
<h2>Back-End Tools</h2>
<p>FlickDev Group have researched and identified several tools and technologies that is best suited to form the back end of the application.</p>

<h3>Data Scraping Tool</h3>
<p>In 2014, Netflix completely closed its previously public API. For FlickDeck’s development, this means that the application will not be able to access an established content database of the streaming service platforms and cannot pull/display data directly from the service. To circumvent this, FlickDeck will need to utilise data scraping tools to obtain the content data.</p>
<p>Data scraping tools, also known as web scraping, use programmed bots to collect content and data from websites by extracting the underlying HTML code and data stored in a database. FlickDev Group have identified that Octoparse is the most suitable data scraping service. Octoparse is available for free for a limited trial period, which we could use to test and assess the service to ensure it suits our project’s need. The reason we’ve selected Octoparse is because it is a visual web-based data scraping tool and does not require expert coding skills to be used effectively: Octoparse has a point-and-click interface that is user-friendly, providing a visual operation pane that is straightforward and intuitive for all users.</p>
<p>Octoparse offers a simple data scraping service for FlickDev Group by automatically extracting content from websites and allowing the data to be saved in a clean and structured format, which can be changed or modified by FlickDeck. Octoparse also enables the user to turn any collected data into custom APIs: by creating a rule set for data collection, Octoparse will then handle the tedious task of collecting and storing the data.</p>

<h3>Database Management System (DBMS)</h3>
	<p>In order to create and maintain the content and user profile data required by FlickDeck, FlickDev Group believe the open-source MariaDB Server will be the most functional and effective DBMS tool.</p>
	<p>MariaDB Server is a relational database tool that organises data into tables which can be linked, or related, based on common attributes. With multiple fields for each record in the database, MariaDB Server allows for quick comparison between records and to create a new table using a single query.</p>
	<p>As an example, a FlickDeck user may like or swipe right on a romantic-comedy movie released in 2008, starring Jane and John Doe. Based on this basic data, the MariaDB Server could be queried to locate and return records that contain at least 2 of the following attributes:</p>
	<p>1.	Year of release: 2008</p>
	<p>2.	Year of release: 2008</p>
  <p>3.	Cast: Jane Doe, John Doe</p>
	<p>These records would be returned as a singular table that could be used to display to the user relatable content. By storing more details about the movie or TV show and narrowing the scope of the database query, the relational database will return records that closer match the user’s viewing preferences and could help suggest more relatable content.
Simultaneously, MariaDB Server will also be extremely effective at creating, maintaining, and comparing unique user profiles.</p>

<h3>Payment Platform</h3>
	<p>A mobile payment gateway is a service that processes electronic transactions and payment authorisation.  </p>
	<p>A key advantage of using third party payment gateways is that the buyer is not providing their personal information to an individual seller, but to the provider of the payment system, which is developed with high-level encryption and security measures, and in turn, the seller doesn’t need to spend money on software development or ensuring customer data security.
After doing some research, we narrowed our choices down to two options. Stripe or PayPal.
The fees per transaction are the same for both services (2.9% + 30c), PayPal has over 267 million customer accounts worldwide, so it’s a trusted and recognized name in the eCommerce industry and our apps users would be more likely to have an existing account.
Stripe offers a recurring billing option which adds to the convenience of the product, plus Stripe’s development tools offer more flexibility and customisation for app integration.  </p>
<hr class="major" />
<h2>Skills required</h2>
<p>To develop FlickDeck, there are a number of specific systems and tools we have identified that require specialised skill sets, which are as follows:</p>
<p>1.	Database Management System</p>
<p>o	MySql, PHP, and Java Script (Spinx, 2020)</p>
<p>o	Significant SQL and database management knowledge </p>
<p>2.	IOS and Android app development</p>
<p>o	iOS app development would require Swift (Apple, 2020). </p>
<p>o	Android app can be written in Kotlin (Android, 2020).</p>
<p>2.	Website development</p>
<p>o	HTML, CSS and JavaScript (GeeksforGeeks, 2020) </p>
<p>FlickDev Group have also identified several key professions that would be necessary to bring the project to completion.</p>

<h3>Project Manager</h3>
<p>The Project Manager would ensure the project is kept on track and on time by supervising and managing the participants until a successful outcome.  Even though their roles differ during the project, they will need to have highly developed leadership, task management, cost management, and communication skills.</p>

<h3>Developers</h3>
<p>Developers will be required to physically code and program the FlickDeck mobile apps, website and necessary software infrastructure. They will require a proficiency in various programming languages, including Python, HTML5, Java, C++, Objective-C, Swift, and C#, and demonstrate substantial problem solving and analytical skills.</p>

<h3>Designers</h3>
<p>Designers will help develop and tweak the overall user experience of the FlickDeck applications, ensuring FlickDeck remains visually appealing, user-friendly, simple and intuitive. Skills range from an excellent knowledge of photo-editing software to an understanding of current and future trends within a commercial environment; designers will also display a high attention to detail, and a creative and innovative method of approaching tasks.</p>

<h3>Sales and Marketing Specialists</h3>
<p>FlickDeck will require a Sales and Marketing team to market and sell the product to our target audience. They will ensure the application is profitable and being used as intended, employing a wide range of media and tools to advertise FlickDeck. The team will display strong communication abilities, negotiation Skills, business acumen, and general business awareness.</p>

<h3>Security Specialists </h3>
<p>For the continued use of FlickDeck, Security Specialists will be crucial in maintaining and managing the safety and security of the applications and, most importantly, our user’s data. The security specialist must have strong I.T. skills, and an excellent and current knowledge of programming languages, hardware, software, and networking. By employing analytical and physical problem-solving skills, specialists can help identify any possible weaknesses within the applications or infrastructure, as well as identify and prevent any malicious attacks.</p>

<h2>Changes made to project plan</h2>
<p>After thoroughly discussing our project idea from Assessment 2, in conjunction with the feedback received from the RMIT marker, FlickDev Group established that the primary goal and our core deliverable for this project would be to develop a functioning prototype of the FlickDeck application. We wanted to demonstrate the core functionality and UX of FlickDeck, which we were able to do by using the wireframing and prototyping tool Figma. Developing a functioning prototype also allowed us to incorporate a demonstration of the app into the Assessment 5 video presentation, which we believed was the best method of displaying the project’s primary goal. </p>
<hr class="major" />

<h2>Core Deliverable/Artefact: develop and deliver functioning prototype</h2>
<p>As determined in the previous ‘Aims’ and ‘Changes made to project plan’ sections, FlickDev Group determined that our primary goal was to deliver was to develop and deliver a functioning prototype of the FlickDeck mobile app. Building on our project idea from Assessment 2, we set out a clear structure and design wireframe of the FlickDeck application, identifying that we wanted to demonstrate the core user experience and workflow of the application.</p>
<p>To create the wireframe and prototype, FlickDev Group used the web-based collaborative platform Figma. Offering a strong focus on collaborative workflows, with the ability to edit files together in real-time and file changes supported by version history, Figma allowed FlickDev Group to construct a wireframe, design screens and functioning prototype, with the ability for users to observe the work or test the prototype themselves.</p>
<p>During the design and development of the FlickDeck prototype, we ensured that the project aim of creating a simple, easy to use application was the primary focus of any choices we made; this has led us to create a functioning prototype that is accessible, fun to use and delivers content in a dynamic way.</p>
<p>As well as demonstrating the core UX through the prototype, Figma has also allowed the FlickDev Group to create an early concept of the application’s UI. Although this would likely change significantly if the project was to be developed further, the current UI is able to accurately communicate pivotal data and information in an accessible and intuitive manner; rather than the user having to scroll through large blocks of text or tiles, content and preferences are displayed so that the user can quickly and easily understand and interact with these components.</p>
<hr class="major" />

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>As discussed in the previous section, we believe that as a group we were able to complete and deliver our primary goal of a functioning prototype for this project that successfully demonstrates the aim of the FlickDeck project.</p>
<p>During the development of the FlickDeck project idea, we encountered several dead-ends or obstacles that we are currently unable to overcome. The primary obstacle we discovered was due to the lack of official streaming service APIs, particularly Netflix’s; without these APIs, it is extremely difficult to obtain data from the streaming service’s content databases. Together with a lack of prior experience and expertise with data scraping tools, database management software, application and website design and development, payment platforms – all of which are vital to developing our project – we decided to focus on delivering the functioning prototype for this project.</p>
<hr class="major" />

<h2>Future of FlickDeck</h2>
<p>If the FlickDeck project were to be fully developed, it is reasonable to assume that users will be able to consume more content; eliminating the stress and pressure of picking the ‘right’ movie or TV show will help create a more enjoyable and care-free experience for users and households. FlickDeck will ultimately provide a fun and dynamic method of interacting with content.</p>
<p>In the future, we believe that FlickDeck could be developed to support additional streaming services. We also believe FlickDeck could be integrated with these services in a way that matched content through FlickDeck could be added to the recommended or ‘watch next’ lists within the streaming service itself.</p>
